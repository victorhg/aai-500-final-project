# Project Timeline

- Module 2 (by the end of Week 2): The course instructor will group students into teams of two to three members.
- Module 4 (by the end of Week 4): Each team will select and introduce a dataset. The team representative will submit the "Team Project Status Update Form."
- Module 7 (by the end of Week 7): Each team will submit the following deliverables for the course project in the final week:
- Technical Report: One PDF document with your final technical report. This should describe your preparation and analysis of the data, discuss the final model selection, and describe the statistics behind your final model selection.
- Team Presentation: One 8-10 minute video presentation by all team members. Do not exceed 10 minutes. Submit one mp4 file. This should be presented as a business presentation of your analysis to a non-technical audience. You will present your analysis and findings in a way that is understandable to any non-technical executive or business leader. This presentation should include one slide to showcase your collaborative efforts; you will create a presentation slide highlighting each team member's individual names and their contributions to the final project work and deliverables.
