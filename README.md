# General Porpose of this project

## Introduction
Magic the Gathering is one of the most famous card games in the world. First published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast, it has become a benchmark of the modern fantasy games, getting more than 40 million players around the world (Schmidt., 2023).

With more than 23,000 unique cards, the game is a phenomenon, having worldwide regional championships with cash prizes up to $ 10 million. For example, The Las Vegas Grand Prix championship receives close to 11,000 participants every edition.

The game also has a thriving primary and secondary market for cards. The rarest card in the game, the Black Lotus, has been sold for $ 600,000 on an auction, with some cards receiving even higher expected value.

We believe that there's a lot to learn from analyzing the card assets in relations to their general prices in the secondary market, and understand better how we can create models that allows us to predict price fluctuations an possibily understand how deck composition affects pricing. Because the market is super madure, it is also easier to collect the informatio necessary to run the experiments.

We also believe that the problem space is useful to be applied in the future to different market assets that are comercialized on secondary markets

## Possible hypothesis
We are still analyzing the best hypothesis that would be feasible to our project, given time constraints 

- Card price prediction based on features and rarity
- Win rate estimations based on deck composition
- Card synergy compositions 
- Pay to win? influence of price on deck composition and win rate (possible hypothesis: win rate increases as you spend more money? Expensive decks win more?)

## Reference Project Timeline

- Module 2 (by the end of Week 2): The course instructor will group students into teams of two to three members.
- Module 4 (by the end of Week 4): Each team will select and introduce a dataset. The team representative will submit the "Team Project Status Update Form."
- Module 7 (by the end of Week 7): Each team will submit the following deliverables for the course project in the final week:
- Technical Report: One PDF document with your final technical report. This should describe your preparation and analysis of the data, discuss the final model selection, and describe the statistics behind your final model selection.
- Team Presentation: One 8-10 minute video presentation by all team members. Do not exceed 10 minutes. Submit one mp4 file. This should be presented as a business presentation of your analysis to a non-technical audience. You will present your analysis and findings in a way that is understandable to any non-technical executive or business leader. This presentation should include one slide to showcase your collaborative efforts; you will create a presentation slide highlighting each team member's individual names and their contributions to the final project work and deliverables.
